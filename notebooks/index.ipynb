    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Across Africa’s rapidly evolving retail landscape, access to clean, reliable sales data remains one of the biggest challenges for consumer brands. Supermarket systems are fragmented, inconsistent, and often incomplete, making it difficult for manufacturers to understand how their products truly perform in-store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Business Understanding\n",
    "Bidco Africa is one of the largest Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) manufacturers in East Africa, producing a diverse portfolio of everyday consumer products (including cooking oils, margarine, soaps, detergents, and juices) distributed through all major supermarket chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating in a competitive and price-sensitive retail environment, Bidco’s performance depends on its ability to understand product sales dynamics across different stores, categories, and regions. Retail execution, pricing consistency, and promotion effectiveness are key levers that directly influence both market share and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, like many FMCG companies in emerging markets, Bidco’s visibility into retail performance is limited by fragmented, inconsistent, and incomplete data sourced from multiple supermarket systems. Without a reliable data layer, it becomes difficult to accurately assess how pricing and promotions drive sales or how Bidco’s products are positioned against competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Bidco’s commercial and marketing teams face a critical challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    ">They need to understand how their products perform across different stores and categories, how pricing and promotions influence sales, and how their price positioning compares to competitors within each product segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw retail data provided by supermarket partners is complex and unstructured — often containing missing values, duplicate entries, and irregular pricing patterns. These issues undermine confidence in insights and decision-making.\n",
    "Without a consistent analytical framework, Bidco cannot accurately answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which SKUs drive the most sales uplift during promotions?\n",
    "2. Where are Bidco’s prices too high or too low relative to competitors?\n",
    "3. Are there specific stores or suppliers whose data cannot be trusted?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "The aim of this project is to engineer, validate, and analyze a week’s worth of raw supermarket sales data to create a trusted analytical layer that reveals how pricing, promotions, and competition affect Bidco’s product performance across stores and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work demonstrates how a data engineering pipeline can transform messy, transactional retail data into actionable commercial intelligence for brand and marketing teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "To achieve this aim, the project is structured around three main objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Health Assessment\n",
    "* Audit the raw dataset for missing, duplicate, and anomalous records.\n",
    "* Detect unreliable stores or suppliers based on data integrity.\n",
    "* Assign a data quality score to quantify dataset reliability per entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Promotional & Performance Analysis\n",
    "* Identify SKUs “on promotion” based on realized price drops relative to RRP.\n",
    "* Compute promo uplift, coverage, and price impact metrics.\n",
    "* Reveal which Bidco products benefit most from promotional activity and which categories show limited responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pricing Index Development\n",
    "* Benchmark Bidco’s realized average prices against competitors within the same Sub-Department and Section across stores.\n",
    "* Build a pricing index to classify Bidco’s positioning as premium, parity, or discount relative to peers.\n",
    "* Highlight where price strategy shifts by region or retailer."

It then classifies each store’s positioning as *Premium, Discount, or Near-Market* based on how the brand’s prices compare to competitors. An overall metric summarizes the brand’s average pricing and discount across all stores, providing a clear, actionable snapshot of how the brand is positioned in the market and helping commercial teams make informed pricing and promotional decisions."
