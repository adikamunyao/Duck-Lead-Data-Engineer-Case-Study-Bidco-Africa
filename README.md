# Duck-Lead-Data-Engineer-Case-Study-Bidco-Africa
This repository contains the submission for the Lead Data Engineer Case Study at Duck.

## Project Overview

The project simulates a real-world data engineering and analytics scenario for Bidco Africa, one of the largest FMCG manufacturers in East Africa.
The task focuses on transforming messy supermarket sales data into actionable insights about data quality, promotional performance, and price positioning.

All analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, supported by a lightweight FastAPI service exposing the computed KPIs as JSON.

## Objectives
Working as Duck’s Data Engineer, helping Bidco answer key commercial questions:

1. **Check and score data quality** so we know whether the dataset can be trusted.
2. **Transform the data** into KPIs that show how promotions and pricing impact performance.
3. **Present the output** clearly for a non-technical stakeholder (e.g., a brand manager).
